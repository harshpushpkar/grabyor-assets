/**
 * Implementation notes for server-side:
 * 
 * To make this work with Hostinger or any other file hosting service:
 * 
 * 1. Create a build script that scans your assets folder structure
 * 2. Generate JSON files that describe the available assets and categories
 * 3. These JSON files would be fetched by the client to populate the UI
 * 
 * Example server folder structure:
 * /assets/
 *   /Icons/
 *     icon1.svg
 *     icon2.svg
 *   /Shapes/
 *     shape1.svg
 *   manifest.json (auto-generated)
 *   categories.json (auto-generated)
 * 
 * The manifest.json would contain paths, names, and categories for all assets.
 * The client would fetch this file to display the assets.
